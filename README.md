# control_luz_trastero

I was tired of stay in the dark every time I go to my building personal storage room because the ladder light timer it's always changed to 1 minute, and every neighbor storage room light it's connected to the ladder light timer, so I decided to fix my problem avoiding me to go presh the corridor push-button every few seconds to avoid stay in the dark every time I go to get something from my personal storage room.

Proteus device simulations will be added soon.
